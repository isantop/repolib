    Because Legacy Deb format entries have limitations on how many URIs or
    suites they can contain, many legacy entry files use multiple sources to
    configure multiple URIs, suites, or types. A common example is to have a
    `deb` entry and an otherwise identical `deb-src` entry. To make this
    simpler, we treat legacy sources as a "meta source" and store the individual
    lines in a list.
